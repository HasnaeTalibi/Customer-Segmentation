# Customer-Segmentation
This project applies customer segmentation to the customer data from a company and derives conclusions and data driven ideas based on it.

## Dataset
From Kaggle (<a href='https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python'>link</a>) 

## Customer segmentation
In customer segmentation we categorize similar customers together in the same cluster and analyse them. It can reveal information like:

- who are the most valuable customers of the company
- what kinds of customers does the company have
- This can be used for targeted marketing and other marketing strategies.
- Sometimes it can even reveal a potential white space in the market place which no company has yet occupied. Well we can get creative here.

## Clustering
Clustering is a process in which we put similar data points into the same cluster. There are a lot of algorithms to do this, for example agglomerative heirarchical clustering, kmeans clustering, Gaussian Mixture Model etc.
